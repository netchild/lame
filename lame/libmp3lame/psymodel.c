 * \internal
 * \brief Psychoacoustic model: per-band masking thresholds, block type and
 *        perceptual entropy.
 *
 * For each granule, the model computes how much quantization noise each
 * scalefactor band can contain before a listener hears it. The rest of the
 * encoder uses these thresholds. The quantization loops shape the noise to
 * them. The perceptual entropy controls the bit reservoir. The stereo mode
 * decision reads the thresholds of each channel.
 *
 * \par One entry point, every mode
 *
 * Despite its name, L3psycho_anal_vbr() is used for CBR, ABR and VBR.
 *
 * \par Results lag the input by one granule
 *
 * The block type of a granule is known only after the next granule is
 * analyzed, because an attack makes the granule before it a start block. So
 * the analysis runs on the current granule and returns the results of the
 * previous granule. Callers handle this delay.
 *
 * \par Two frequency partitionings
 *
 * The analysis uses a grid of at most CBANDS partition bands, each about
 * DELBARK bark wide on the Zwicker scale (freq2bark()). init_numline() decides
 * how many are used, from the sample rate. At the end,
 * convert_partition2scalefac() maps the results onto the scalefactor bands of
 * the bitstream, SBMAX_l long and SBMAX_s short. It splits a partition that
 * crosses a scalefactor band boundary between its two neighbors.
 *
 * \par The analysis filter bank is not the coding filter bank
 *
 * The thresholds come from a separate FFT, not from the MDCT that the encoder
 * quantizes: 1024 points with a Blackman window for long blocks, and 256
 * points with a Hann window for each of the three short sub-blocks
 * (init_fft()). This transform is not critically sampled. So it keeps the full
 * energy of the signal and gives a magnitude spectrum to measure tonality on.
 * The thresholds are scaled into the domain of the coder where they are used.
 *
 * \par What the model computes, in order
 *
 * -# Attack detection. vbrpsy_attack_detection() high-passes the input at
 *    fs/4, splits the granule into nine sub-blocks, and compares each with the
 *    one two positions earlier. A large enough ratio counts as an attack, and
 *    an attack selects short blocks.
 * -# Energy per partition band, from the FFT (calc_energy()).
 * -# Tonality, as the ratio of peak to average energy over three neighboring
 *    partitions (calc_mask_index()). Tonal content masks less than noise, so
 *    the index selects how far below the signal the threshold of the band is.
 * -# Spreading. Every band masks its neighbors through s3_func().
 *    vbrpsy_mask_add() combines the contributions, and this is not a plain
 *    power sum.
 * -# Pre-echo control. It keeps thresholds low where higher thresholds would
 *    let noise come before a transient. In the long path it compares with the
 *    two granules before (vbrpsy_compute_masking_l()). In the short path it
 *    compares with the sub-block before, depending on where the attack is in
 *    the granule. That code is in L3psycho_anal_vbr() itself, after the
 *    mapping to scalefactor bands, because only there is the attack position
 *    known.
 * -# Mid/side thresholds, in joint stereo only
 *    (vbrpsy_compute_MS_thresholds()).
 * -# Perceptual entropy, an estimate of how many bits the granule will need
 *    (pecalc_l(), pecalc_s()).
 *
 * \par The absolute threshold is separate
 *
 * Masking thresholds follow the signal. The absolute threshold of hearing is a
 * lower limit for them. Other code computes it: ATHformula(), with the
 * loudness adjustment in adjust_ATH().

   L3psycho_anal.  Compute psycho acoustics.

   Data returned to the calling program must be delayed by one 
   granule. 

   This is done in two places.  
   If we do not need to know the blocktype, the copying
   can be done here at the top of the program: we copy the data for
   the last granule (computed during the last call) before it is
   overwritten with the new data.  It looks like this:
  
   0. static psymodel_data 
   1. calling_program_data = psymodel_data
   2. compute psymodel_data
    
   For data which needs to know the blocktype, the copying must be
   done at the end of this loop, and the old values must be saved:
   
   0. static psymodel_data_old 
   1. compute psymodel_data
   2. compute possible block type of this granule
   3. compute final block type of previous granule based on #2.
   4. calling_program_data = psymodel_data_old
   5. psymodel_data_old = psymodel_data

notes:   When calibrated, feeding this function binary white noise at sample
         values +32767 or -32768 should return values that approach 3.
         ATHformula is used to approximate an equal loudness curve.
future:  Data indicates that the shape of the equal loudness curve varies
         with intensity.  This function might be improved by using an equal
         loudness curve shaped for typical playback levels (instead of the
         ATH, that is shaped for the threshold).  A flexible realization might
         simply bend the existing ATH curve to achieve the desired shape.
         However, the potential gain may not be enough to justify an effort.

/**
 * \brief Approximate the loudness of a granule as an equal-loudness-weighted
 *        power sum.
 *
 * The weights in \a eql_w come from the absolute threshold of hearing, which
 * approximates an equal-loudness contour. The scale is set so that a signal
 * near clipping returns about 1.0, and full-scale binary white noise (samples
 * at +32767 and -32768) returns almost 3.
 *
 * The result controls adjust_ATH(). This is the only place where the encoder
 * adapts to the level of the material.
 *
 * \todo The shape of an equal-loudness contour changes with the level, and the
 *       ATH has the shape at the threshold, not at a typical playback level. A
 *       curve with the shape at playback level would be more accurate. Nobody
 *       has measured whether this is worth the work.

 * bitstream format offers.
 *
 * The granule is high-pass filtered at a quarter of the sample rate, because a
 * transient shows most clearly where the signal is least tonal. Then it is
 * split into nine sub-blocks, and the peak amplitude of each is compared with
 * the sub-block two positions earlier. A ratio above the configured threshold
 * is an attack.
 *
 * Two refinements follow. A periodic signal would trigger the detector in
 * every period, so an attack is ignored where neighboring sub-blocks have
 * similar energy at a low level. And a sub-block whose energy comes in a
 * single spike gets an extra attenuation factor, which is applied later to
 * its threshold.
 *
 * This function also returns the maskings of the previous granule to the
 * caller. This is where the one-granule delay of the model happens.
