  LAME uses this value only to estimate the total number of frames.

  more or fewer samples than this value. Only the estimate is then wrong.

  The default is 2^32-1, which means "length not known". Keep the default for
  a stream whose length is not known in advance.

/*!
  This is one of the two settings that describe the input. The other one is
  \c lame_set_num_channels(). Both have defaults: 44100 Hz and 2 channels. So
  an encoder that is never told about its input initializes without an error
  and encodes the input as CD audio. Always set both.

  This is the sample rate of the samples passed to \c lame_encode_buffer(). It
  is not always the sample rate written into the stream. If it differs from the
  output sample rate (\c lame_set_out_samplerate()), LAME resamples.

  The MP3 stream does not store the input sample rate. Each frame stores the
  output sample rate, which must be one of the rates in the table under
  \c lame_set_out_samplerate(). A decoder reports this output rate. The file
  has no field for the input rate, so the input rate cannot be read back from
  the file. LAME resamples input with a high sample rate down to one of these
  rates.

  This function sets no upper limit. It accepts rates far above the output
  rates, and LAME resamples them.

                         positive value. \c lame_init_params() checks whether

  default is 1, which means no change. The decoder does not use it.

  The scaling happens before the psychoacoustic model sees the signal. So this

/*! Apply a preset. */

  A preset is a set of the settings above that were tuned together by
  listening tests. Using a preset is the recommended way to configure the
  encoder. The settings affect each other, and setting them one by one can
  give a combination that nobody has tested.

  Three kinds of value are accepted:

  - **8 to 320**: an average bitrate in kbps. The preset selects the ABR mode
    and tunes it for that bitrate.
  - **the quality constants** \c V0 to \c V9 (also \c VBR_100 down to
    \c VBR_10): variable bitrate at that quality level. \c V0 is the best.
  - **the named presets** \c STANDARD, \c EXTREME, \c INSANE, \c MEDIUM, their
    \c _FAST variants and \c R3MIX. They stay for compatibility with the
    command-line options of the same names.

  This function writes all the settings of the preset at once. It overwrites
  earlier calls for the same settings. Later calls overwrite the preset. So
  set the preset first, then change single settings.

  Note that **an unknown preset is not reported**. LAME applies nothing, and
  the call returns as for a known value. So a caller who passes a value that
  is neither a bitrate in the range nor one of the constants gets a default
  encode and no message.

/*! Allow or forbid one family of processor instructions. */
/*!
  \deprecated Use \c lame_set_vector_routines().

  Every family is allowed by default. LAME uses a family only if the processor
  has it. So this function can *forbid* an instruction set, but not require
  one. Forbidding one helps to compare the hand-written routines with the plain
  C code, and to work around a processor whose implementation of an
  instruction set is not reliable.

  The families are the values of \c asm_optimizations. They name x86
  instruction sets and mean nothing on other architectures. There the call is
  accepted and changes nothing. The list of families depends on the release,
  so read it from the enum.

  The families depend on each other. \c AVX2 uses the SSE2 routines, so
  forbidding \c SSE also forbids \c AVX2. Forbidding only \c AVX2 keeps the
  SSE tier.

  \c MMX and \c AMD_3DNOW are different. This library has no MMX or 3DNow!
  code, so there is nothing to allow or forbid. The function returns -2 for
  them and stores nothing.

  \since \c AVX2 is available from LAME 4.1, with the vectorized inner loops.
         The other families are older than this interface. Source code that
         must also compile with a 3.100 or older header cannot use the name
         \c AVX2, but it can pass the value. A library that does not know the
         family accepts the call and does nothing.

  \param gfp    the encoder instance.
