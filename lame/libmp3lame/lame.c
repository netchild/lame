 *
 *  OUTLINE:
 *
 * We first have some complex code to determine bitrate,
 * output samplerate and mode.  It is complicated by the fact
 * that we allow the user to set some or all of these parameters,
 * and need to determine best possible values for the rest of them:
 *
 *  1. set some CPU related flags
 *  2. check if we are mono->mono, stereo->mono or stereo->stereo
 *  3.  compute bitrate and output samplerate:
 *          user may have set compression ratio
 *          user may have set a bitrate
 *          user may have set a output samplerate
 *  4. set some options which depend on output samplerate
 *  5. compute the actual compression ratio
 *  6. set mode based on compression ratio
 *
 *  The remaining code is much simpler - it just sets options
 *  based on the mode & compression ratio:
 *
 *   set allow_diff_short based on mode
 *   select lowpass filter based on compression ratio & mode
 *   set the bitrate index, and min/max bitrates for VBR modes
 *   disable VBR tag if it is not appropriate
 *   initialize the bitstream
 *   initialize scalefac_band data
 *   set sideinfo_len (based on channels, CRC, out_samplerate)
 *   write an id3v2 tag into the bitstream
 *   write VBR tag into the bitstream
 *   set mpeg1/2 flag
 *   estimate the number of frames (based on a lot of data)
 *
 *   now we set more flags:
 *   nspsytune:
 *      see code
 *   VBR modes
 *      see code
 *   CBR/ABR
 *      see code
 *
 *  Finally, we set the algorithm flags based on the gfp->quality value
 *  lame_init_qval(gfp);

  \ingroup api_encoding
  Call it once: after \c lame_init() and after all the settings the caller
  wants to change, and before the first \c lame_encode_buffer(). It checks the
  settings and computes everything that was left at its default. It allocates
  the encoding buffers and writes the tags at the start of the stream (through
  \c lame_init_bitstream()).

  Each setter checks only its own value. This function reports a bad
  combination of settings. Every parameter has a default. So an instance
  straight from \c lame_init() initializes without an error, as 44.1 kHz
  stereo input in CD format. A caller that forgets to describe its input gets
  a wrong encode, not an error.

  A second call on the same instance fails and returns -1. So the parameters
  cannot be changed after this call. For different settings, create a new
  instance.

             The instance stays valid after a failure, and its settings are

  The last encoding call for a file. It fills the buffered PCM with silence so
  that the last frame is complete, encodes it, and returns the rest of the MP3
  data. If the library writes the tags itself (see
  \c lame_set_write_id3tag_automatic()), it also adds the ID3v1 tag. The LAME
  tag records how much padding was added, so a decoder that reads the tag does
  not play it.

  A second call does no harm. It finds nothing in the buffer and returns 0.

  This function does not release the instance. Call \c lame_close() after it.
  Use the statistics and tag functions (\c lame_get_lametag_frame(),
  \c lame_mp3_tags_fid(), the histograms) between the two, while the encoder
  state still exists.

  \param gfp             the encoder instance.
  \param mp3buffer       where the last MP3 data is written. At least 7200
                         bytes, which holds everything a flush can write.
  \param mp3buffer_size  size of \a mp3buffer in bytes. 0 means that LAME
                         does not check the size.
  \return the number of bytes written to \a mp3buffer, which can be 0. A

  The first call of the encoding API. It creates the encoder instance that

  default. So a caller only sets what it wants to change.

  This function checks nothing, and no encoding state exists yet.
  \c lame_init_params() does that, after all parameters are set. The usual
  order is:

  \code
  lame_global_flags *gfp = lame_init();

  lame_set_VBR(gfp, vbr_default);
  if (lame_init_params(gfp) < 0) {     // checks the settings, prepares the encoder
      lame_close(gfp);
      return -1;                       // the settings cannot be used
  }
  // ... lame_encode_buffer() per block of PCM ...
  lame_encode_flush(gfp, mp3buf, sizeof mp3buf);
  lame_close(gfp);
  \endcode

  Release every instance from this function with \c lame_close(), also after a
  failed \c lame_init_params().

  All encoder state is in the returned instance. Two encoders need one
  instance each. This does not make LAME thread-safe: **LAME gives no

  must do its own locking.
