/*
 *  The one routine of the x86 vector tier that pays for itself on AArch64.
 *
 *  Three of the seven x86 routines were never written here: clang already
 *  emits the equivalent, including a native 32-bit signed maximum, which is
 *  the only reason the SSE2 sibling of the region maximum exists at all.  Two
 *  more were written, measured and retired - the FFT and the no-escape
 *  counting loop - because both came out slower than the scalar code clang
 *  produces; see @ref vector_dispatch.  What is left is the escape-coded
 *  counting loop, which is worth +3.5 % on a 320 kbit/s encode and +1 % on
 *  VBR.
 *
 *  It builds a table index from a pair of values, x * 16 + y.  The x86
 *  form narrows the region to sixteen bits so that one pmaddwd turns four
 *  pairs into four indices.  Advanced SIMD has no multiply-add-adjacent-pairs
 *  at any width, so the same thing is spelt as a multiply by (xlen, 1) per
 *  lane followed by a pairwise add.  That needs no narrowing, and so none of
 *  the saturation reasoning the x86 file has to carry comes with it.
 *
 *  vpadd_s32 over the halves, rather than vpaddq_s32 or vuzp1q/vuzp2q: those
 *  are AArch64-only spellings, while this one is in the ACLE for both A32 and
 *  A64 - and 32-bit ARM is the whole reason this tier is probed for at run
 *  time rather than assumed.
 *
 *  It reads [ix, end), whose length is even, and touches nothing else; the
 *  remainder is consumed pair by pair exactly as the scalar loop consumes it.
