/*
 *  Sixteen values per pass, and the gather stays as wide as the arithmetic:
 *  the table is thirty-two-bit floats and the indices are thirty-two-bit, so
 *  every lane of it is used.
 *
 *  What this tier adds over the narrower ones is not only the width - it is
 *  that the leftovers need no separate code.  The mask registers make a short
 *  pass a first-class case, so where the other tiers step down through a
 *  narrower block and then a scalar pair, this reaches the end of the run in
 *  the same loop it started.  That matters here more than the width does:
 *  these runs are short, so the drain was a large part of the work rather
 *  than a rounding error at the end of it.
 *
 *  A masked load also reads no memory in its inactive lanes, so running off
 *  the end of the array is not merely harmless, it does not happen.
 *
 *  Every value is computed exactly as the scalar loop computes it - a gather
 *  is a load, and the arithmetic around it is elementwise - so this tier and
 *  the AVX2 one and the SSE2 one and the C one all produce the same output.
