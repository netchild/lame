  \c hip_decode_init_gapless() removes them inside the decoder. Use it unless

  the last frame at the end of the input.

  Call it before decoding starts. A block set later describes only the frames
  decoded after it. The block belongs to the caller and must exist as long as
  the decoder, because the decoder keeps the pointer, not a copy.

  \c lame.h declares \c plotting_data but does not define it, because its
  layout is internal and can change. A caller that only uses the hooks passes
  the pointer and never needs the fields. A caller that reads them uses the
  internal header, which is not part of the API.
