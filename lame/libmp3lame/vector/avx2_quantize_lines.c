 *  Unlike the Huffman table lookups, this one has a gather worth having: the
 *  table is thirty-two-bit floats and the indices are thirty-two-bit, so no
 *  lane is wasted, and the instruction replaces four round trips through
 *  general registers and the shuffles that reassembled them.
 *
 *  Every value is computed exactly as the scalar loop computes it - a gather
 *  is a load, and the arithmetic around it is elementwise - so this tier and
 *  the SSE2 one and the C one all produce the same output.
